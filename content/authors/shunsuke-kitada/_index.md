Shunsuke Kitada (ÂåóÁî∞ ‰øäËºî in Japanese) is a Ph.D student at Major in applied informatics, graduate school of science and engineering, Hosei University under the supervision of Prof. [Hitoshi Iyatomi](http://iyatomi-lab.info/front-e.html).
His research interests include deep learning-based natural language processing, computer vision, medical image processing, and computational advertising.

His personality traits can be summarized as follows:
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Love research and development.** He is enjoying research life, and he is currently focusing on three research topics simultaneously, e.g., natural language processing, medical image-based computer vision, computational advertising.
- üìù **Every day read and implement the SoTA models.** He has released many re-implementations of models using mainly Chainer and PyTorch. Therefore, based on state-of-the-art cases, he can advise on deep learning-based product design.
- üòÑ **High technical communicativity.** Summarize what he made and what he studied, and spread such information. This shows that he can input and output regularly.
