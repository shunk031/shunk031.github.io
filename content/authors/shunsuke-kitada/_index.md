Shunsuke Kitada ÔºàÂåóÁî∞ ‰øäËºî in Japanese) is a Research Scientist at Computer Vision Lab (CVL), LINE Corp. His research interest is now on computational advertising with a focus on automatic geneartion/evaluation and assistive technology for multi-modal ad creatives.

Previously, he got his Ph.D. in 2023 at major in applied informatics, graduate school of science and engineering, Hosei University under the supervision of Prof. [Hitoshi Iyatomi](https://iyatomi-lab.info/english/outline_theme/overview). His project was to improve prediction performance and model interpretability through attention mechanisms from basic and applied research perspectives.

His personality traits can be summarized as follows:
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Love research and development.** He is enjoying research life, and he is currently focusing on three research topics simultaneously, e.g., natural language processing, medical image-based computer vision, computational advertising.
- üìù **Every day read and implement the SoTA models.** He has released many re-implementations of models using mainly Chainer and PyTorch. Therefore, based on state-of-the-art cases, he can advise on deep learning-based product design.
- üòÑ **High technical communicativity.** Summarize what he made and what he studied, and spread such information. This shows that he can input and output regularly.
