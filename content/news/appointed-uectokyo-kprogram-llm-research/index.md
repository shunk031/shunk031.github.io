I’m thrilled to announce that, in addition to my main role at LYCorp., I’ve just started as an part-time researcher at The University of Electro-Communications! 
Under the guidance of Prof. [Satoshi Hara](https://sites.google.com/site/sato9hara/), I’ll be working on the K Program [“Red Teaming Framework for Misalignment in Large Language Models.”](https://projectdb.jst.go.jp/grant/JST-PROJECT-24017354/) 
Looking forward to making an impact in both industry and academia!
