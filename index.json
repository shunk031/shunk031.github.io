You end up wasting time on cd and shell completion. On top of that, once you start creating branches for development or checking out other branches to review Pull Requests, the overhead of switching branches and managing stashes just keeps increasing. I often mess up branch switches, run into conflicts, or almost lose my changes.\nThese problems become even more visible once you start using coding agents like Claude Code or Codex. The more tasks you run in parallel, the more likely things are to collide if you only have a single working directory. And of course, you want to unleash your coding agents as much as possible 😄.\nIn this article, I’ll show how combining the following three tools can significantly improve your daily development workflow. And yes—please do use coding agents.\nUse ghq to standardize where repositories are cloned (so things don’t fall apart as they grow) Use gwq to make git worktree operations painless (parallel work becomes the default) Use fzf to minimize directory hopping (list → fuzzy search → instant jump) Table of Contents Why git worktree Works So Well with Coding Agents The Tooling Stack Used in This Article ghq: Standardize Where You Clone Repositories fzf: Turn Any List into a “Selectable UI” gwq: Manage Worktrees “the ghq Way” Unifying clone and worktree Under the Same Root Setup: Point Both ghq and gwq to ~/ghq Creating a “Jump” Command: ghq + fzf Summary: Centralize, Select, and Run in Parallel Why git worktree Works So Well with Coding Agents git worktree allows you to have multiple working directories (worktrees) for a single repository. The official Git documentation clearly explains the distinction between the main worktree and linked worktrees, and recommends cleaning up unused linked worktrees with git worktree remove. 1\nThe reason this works so well with coding agents is simple: your workspaces are isolated.\nTask A progresses in worktree A Task B progresses in worktree B Even if you run agents for both, they’re not fighting over the same repository Anthropic’s best practices also introduce workflows where multiple Claude sessions are run simultaneously using worktrees. 2\nThe Tooling Stack Used in This Article ghq: Standardize Where You Clone Repositories ghq is a CLI tool for organizing cloned repositories. Its philosophy is to place them under a common root using a structure like host/owner/repo.\nWith the ghq list command, you can see all repositories you’ve cloned locally. When combined with fzf (covered later), this becomes a powerful UI for jumping between repositories. The ghq list --full-path command outputs full paths and is also featured in the official ghq handbook as a common pattern to pair with fzf. 3\nfzf: Turn Any List into a “Selectable UI” fzf is a fast, interactive fuzzy finder that runs in the terminal. It takes input from stdin, filters it in real time, and lets you select items interactively.\ngwq: Manage Worktrees “the ghq Way” gwq is a CLI tool for efficiently managing git worktrees. Its README describes it as:\n“Just like ghq manages clones, gwq manages worktrees.”\nIt’s designed around fuzzy-finder-driven workflows, making it easy to create, switch, and delete worktrees.\nUnifying clone and worktree Under the Same Root The key idea of this article is:\nBy placing both original repositories and git worktree directories under the same root (e.g. ~/ghq), you can target a single location with fzf, making navigation lightning-fast.\nBelow is a concrete setup.\nSetup: Point Both ghq and gwq to ~/ghq ghq: Fix the Root to ~/ghq Configure ghq to use ~/ghq as its root. ghq reads this from git config.\n[ghq] root = ~/ghq With this setup, running ghq get github.com/owner/repo results in the following structure:\n~/ghq/ github.com/ owner/ repo/ gwq: Place Worktrees Under ~/ghq gwq is configured via ~/.config/gwq/config.toml, where you can set worktree.basedir and naming.template.\n[naming] template = \u0026#39;{{.Host}}/{{.Owner}}/{{.Repository}}={{.Branch}}\u0026#39; [worktree] basedir = \u0026#39;~/ghq\u0026#39; gwq supports template variables such as Host, Owner, Repository, and Branch, and even allows branch name sanitization. This is clearly documented in its README.\nI personally use the format:\n\u0026#39;{{.Host}}/{{.Owner}}/{{.Repository}}={{.Branch}}\u0026#39; If you instead follow the gwq default and separate directories by {{.Branch}}, worktrees end up nested inside the ghq-cloned repository. That makes them harder to find via fzf, so be careful.\nWith the configuration above, running gwq add feature-branch produces something like:\n~/ghq/ github.com/shunk031/app # original repo (ghq) github.com/shunk031/app=feature-auth # worktree (gwq) github.com/shunk031/app=bugfix-login # worktree (gwq) ... github.com/shunk031/infra # another repo (ghq) github.com/shunk031/infra=refactor-tf # worktree (gwq) Creating a “Jump” …","date":1768574726,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1770812977,"objectID":"a658c219c8b0837c33702e8b97df8d2f","permalink":"https://shunk031.me/post/ghq-gwq-fzf-worktree/","publishdate":"2026-01-16T23:45:26+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/ghq-gwq-fzf-worktree/","section":"post","summary":"Coding agents thrive on parallelism, and by unifying repository clones and git worktrees under a single `ghq` root and navigating them with `fzf`, you can create a workflow that’s faster, cleaner, and friendlier for both humans and AI.","tags":["git","ghq","gwq","fzf","claudecode"],"title":"A Coding-Agent-Friendly Environment Is Friendly to Humans Too: ghq × gwq × fzf","type":"post"},{"authors":["Shunsuke Kitada, Ph.D."],"categories":["Tech Blog","Conference Report"],"content":"Our Paper and Workshop Accepted at ICCV 2025, the Top International Conference on Computer Vision (Participation Report) Hello, I’m Shunsuke Kitada (@shunk031), and I work at LY Corporation on research and development for image generation and design generation.\nFrom October 19 to 23, 2025, I attended and presented at the International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2025, held in Hawaii, USA.\nIn this article, I’ll share insights gained from ICCV workshops and the main conference.

To address this, we introduce the Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique, Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent representations from both foreground and composite generation processes, transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative workflows.","tags":["Preprint","Non-Refereed","Layer-wise Image Generation","Diffusion Model","International Publication"],"title":"TAUE: Training-free Noise Transplant and Cultivation Diffusion Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shunsuke Kitada, Ph.D."],"categories":[],"content":" Table of Contents Introduction The difficulty of a dynamically typed language What are type hints?

In this column, we compactly introduce the background of why Python type hints were born, their advantages, and how to use them. If you’ve postponed it thinking “it looks a bit bothersome…”, once you actually use it you’ll realise it’s a reliable element that can significantly raise development efficiency for both teams and individuals. First, let’s start with understanding the meaning of using type hints, and introduce them in a relaxed way.\nIntroduction Python is widely loved as a language thanks to its ease of writing code and low learning cost. However, as development progresses, have you ever faced issues like “what type was this variable again?” or “what kind of return value did this function have?” Especially in team development, or when reading your own code after several days or months, lack of type information can lead to major confusion.\nWhat we pay attention to here is type hints. Type hints provide developers with the “hint that this variable is assumed to be this type”, and can significantly improve readability and maintainability. Since type hints don’t force strict checking at runtime, one of their appealing features is that you can introduce them without losing the “dynamic typed ease-of-use”. In this article we compactly introduce how Python type hints came about, their benefits, and how to use them. Let’s begin by understanding the significance of type hints and starting with a relaxed introduction.\nThe difficulty of a dynamically typed language Python, as a dynamically typed language, has the advantage that you don’t always have to worry about types when writing code, which makes it easy for many developers to use. However, as code becomes more complex, you often encounter questions such as “what kind of value was this variable originally thinking of?” or “what does this function return?” Particularly in the following kinds of cases, you might not realise a bug until you execute the code.\nFor example, consider a simple case:\ndef greet(name): return \u0026#34;Hello, \u0026#34; + name print(greet(\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;)) # \u0026#34;Hello, Alice\u0026#34; print(greet(42)) # TypeError: Can\u0026#39;t convert \u0026#39;int\u0026#39; object to str implicitly Although this code may look harmless, if you pass an integer as the argument when a string is assumed, a runtime error occurs. In small‐scale code you can easily find the cause, but in large‐scale or long‐term projects, or when dealing with code written by someone else, it takes time to locate where a type mismatch occurred.\nMoreover, the issue unique to dynamically typed languages — “type mismatch or unintended type conversion discovered later” — can greatly slow down development speed. There are more and more situations where you don’t know until you run the code, and in major refactoring or collaborations confusion easily arises.\nAs seen in the relationship between JavaScript and TypeScript, an approach of introducing the concept of types later into a dynamically typed language to use it more safely has become commonplace. In Python as well, type hints are drawing attention as a method to explicitly provide type information while preserving the ease of a dynamically typed language. This leads to the importance of type hints described next.\nWhat are type hints? Even in dynamically typed Python, there is a mechanism where you can annotate in the source “what type the argument or return value assumes” by writing it, thereby improving development efficiency and maintainability. This is called type hints. Since Python 3.5, based on PEP 484, the specification was introduced, and by using the typing module, you can explicitly declare type‐related information in your source code.\nType hints function purely as “hints”, and Python does not perform strict type checking at runtime. However, static type checkers (for example: mypy/pyright) or IDE built-in autocomplete features use type hints to warn incorrect usage and deliver more accurate code completion.

In this column, we compactly introduce the background of why Python type hints were born, their advantages, and how to use them. If you’ve postponed it thinking “it looks a bit bothersome…”, once you actually use it you’ll realise it’s a reliable element that can significantly raise development efficiency for both teams and individuals. First, let’s start with understanding the meaning of using type hints, and introduce them in a relaxed way.\n","tags":[],"title":"On Python Type Hints that Save Everything!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Shunsuke Kitada, Ph.D."],"categories":["tech"],"content":"This article explains an approach to dotfiles management that emphasizes testability, using the author’s dotfiles repository shunk031/dotfiles as a case study.\nTable of Contents Introduction Dotfiles and Dotfiles Repositories The Problem of Untested Scripts My Repository’s Approach: Testable Configuration Architecture Design: Testable Configuration Repository Structure Design Philosophy Test \u0026amp; CI/CD Strategy Unit Test Implementation with Bats Comprehensive Verification with GitHub Actions Implementation Details and Operational Flow Structure and Implementation Examples of Setup Scripts Development and Maintenance Flow Conclusion Introduction Dotfiles and Dotfiles Repositories The dotfiles refer to configuration files that start with a “.” (dot) such as .bashrc, .vimrc, and .gitconfig. In recent years, dotfiles repositories that manage these files using Git repositories have become widely popular among developers.\nThe dotfiles repositories often function not just as configuration file management tools, but as automated development environment setup tools that include configuration files, installation scripts, and setup scripts. This enables quick and consistent setup on new machines and environments.\nThe Problem of Untested Scripts Most setup and installation scripts included in dotfiles repositories are not tested for proper functionality (which is painful). As a result, various problems can occur when setting up in new environments. Script errors, installation failures of some tools due to dependency issues, and script malfunctions due to OS updates may go unnoticed until actually executed. It’s extremely stressful when you get a new computer or environment and excitedly start the setup process, only to have errors occur midway through, preventing the environment setup from completing.\nThis lack of quality assurance results in what should be automated environment construction consuming a lot of time on manual problem-solving and debugging.\nMy Repository’s Approach: Testable Configuration To solve the above problems, my dotfiles repository builds an architecture that emphasizes testability. Setup scripts are managed as independent files to enable individual testing, quality is ensured through automated testing with Bats, and continuous testing and code coverage measurement are performed in macOS and Ubuntu environments using GitHub Actions.\nFor managing dotfiles, I’ve adopted chezmoi. chezmoi is a modern dotfiles management tool with high popularity on GitHub (10,000+⭐️). Written in Go as a single, dependency-free binary, chezmoi is easy to install even on a brand-new, clean environment.\nEnvironment setup on a new machine can be executed with the following very simple one-liner using chezmoi’s official installer1.\nsh -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)\u0026#34; -- init --apply $GITHUB_USERNAME Environment-specific settings can be dynamically generated using chezmoi’s template functionality based on Go’s text/template as follows.\n[user] # Can be dynamically specified via template functionality name = \u0026#34;{{.name}}\u0026#34; # - User name email = \u0026#34;{{.email}}\u0026#34; # - Email address etc. {{- if eq .chezmoi.os \u0026#34;darwin\u0026#34;}} # macOS-specific settings [credential] helper = osxkeychain {{- end}} In this way, we aim to achieve reliable dotfiles management by ensuring script quality through testable configuration and flexibly managing environment-specific settings through chezmoi’s template functionality.\nArchitecture Design: Testable Configuration Repository Structure My repository is broadly divided into three directories: home/, install/, and tests/, managing dotfiles, environment setup scripts, and automated tests independently.\n. ├── ... │ ├── home/ # dotfiles under chezmoi management │ ├── dot_bashrc # - deployed as ~/.bashrc │ ├── dot_vimrc # - deployed as ~/.vimrc │ ├── dot_config/ # - deployed as ~/.config/ │ └── .chezmoi.yaml.tmpl # - chezmoi configuration file │ ├── install/ # setup scripts (testable) │ ├── common/ # - common installation scripts │ ├── macos/ # - macOS-specific scripts │ └── ubuntu/ # - Ubuntu-specific scripts │ ├── tests/ # automated tests with Bats │ ├── install/ # - tests for installation scripts │ └── files/ # - tests for files after chezmoi deployment │ └── ... Design Philosophy The core of this architecture lies in “separation of concerns” and “maximizing testability”. Traditional dotfiles repositories mix configuration files and setup scripts, making testing difficult, but this configuration clearly separates each element.\nThe install/ directory: Easy Unit Testing Through Script Separation By making setup scripts independent from chezmoi, individual testing becomes possible.\ninstall/common/rust.sh: Installation of tools used commonly across machines (e.g., Rust) install/macos/common/brew.sh: Installation of Homebrew used commonly on macOS install/ubuntu/common/misc.sh: Installation of tools used commonly on Ubuntu (e.g., curl, jq) Platform-specific configuration separates OS-specific logic, allowing each to be …","date":1759748400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1770812977,"objectID":"5d8456854878f83db252650b947a94cb","permalink":"https://shunk031.me/post/testable-dotfiles-management-with-chezmoi/","publishdate":"2025-10-06T20:00:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/testable-dotfiles-management-with-chezmoi/","section":"post","summary":"This article explains an approach to dotfiles management that emphasizes testability, using the author's dotfiles repository shunk031/dotfiles as a case study.","tags":["dotfiles","chezmoi","Bats","GitHub Actions"],"title":"Testable Dotfiles Management With Chezmoi","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yoshihiro Fukuhara","Hirokatsu Kataoka","Püren Güler","Shunsuke Kitada, Ph.D.","Xavier Boix","Dan Hendrycks","Keisuke Tateno","Shinichi Mae","Tatsuya Komatsu","Nishant Rai","Ryo Nakamura","Risa Shinoda","Takahiro Itazuri","Yoshiki Kubotani","Guarin Flück","Wadim Kehl","Kazuki Kozuka"],"categories":["Workshop","ICCV2025"],"content":"We are happy to announce the ICCV 2025 workshop “FOUND: Foundation Data for Industrial Tech Transfer” has been accepted! This workshop will be held in conjunction with ICCV 2025, one of the top conferences in computer vision. The workshop will highlight the critical role of data in building foundation models, with a particular focus on robust dataset construction and industry-driven applications.\nAbout FOUND Workshop Recently, Transformer-based foundation models have achieved outstanding performance across a broad spectrum of benchmarks spanning recognition and generation tasks, and their versatility has fueled rapid advances in both AI research and industrial deployment. To seamlessly adapt these models to downstream tasks in diverse real-world domains-including medicine, manufacturing, robotics, and the creative industries-and thereby deliver tangible impact on human life, it is indispensable to develop Tech Transfer technologies that encompass domain-specific fine-tuning and robust MLOps pipelines, where the decisive factor is the breadth and quality of data available for those tasks. At the same time, model evaluation is approaching saturation on conventional IID benchmarks, prompting growing calls to redesign evaluation metrics and tasks that dispense with the IID assumption and explicitly capture out-of-distribution (OOD) and long-tail phenomena. Advancing both (i) Tech Transfer to heterogeneous downstream tasks and (ii) the definition of next-generation evaluation criteria therefore hinges on curating and exploiting broader and deeper data resources-Foundation Data, as we term them. Against this backdrop, the ICCV 2025 workshop “FOUND: Foundation Data for Industrial Tech Transfer” will convene researchers from industry and academia to share techniques for realizing Foundation Data and to engage in comprehensive discussions on model adaptation and the design of novel evaluation tasks grounded in such data, with the ultimate aim of opening new horizons for AI research and application.\nTopics of Interest The workshop focus on following topics across the diverse domains covered by our organizers:\nData-centric approach\nData collection from real-world/non-Internet domain Data curation from rough data in the wild into sophisticated and labeled datasets Data crawling, annotation, and cleansing for training of AI models Data labeling with {Self, Semi, Weakly, Un}-supervised learning without any human instructions Data generation with synthetic, graphics, and artificial images Data and a new evaluation setup for assessing powerful foundation models Data representation and benchmarks for new sensing modalities (e.g., event cameras, multimodal sensors) Tech transfer approach\nAdaptation techniques from large-/middle-scale AI models Evaluation techniques to assess the optimal AI models for complex downstream tasks {Few-shot, Zero-shot} learning techniques {Out-of, Long-tail} distribution scenarios Security, privacy, ethics, and accountability toward real-world applications Model adaptation strategies for novel sensor data and multimodal fusion

Recently, LLM providers have evolved these models into large vision-language models (LVLM), which shows prominent multi-modal understanding capabilities. Then, how can we leverage this multi-modal power for layout generation? To answer this, we propose Visual-Aware Self-Correction LAyout GeneRation (VASCAR) for LVLM-based content-aware layout generation. In our method, LVLMs iteratively refine their outputs with reference to rendered layout images, which are visualized as colored bounding boxes on poster backgrounds.

に少しでもお力になれたらと思い、申請書の公開に至りました。2\n質問等にもできる限りお答えします。連絡先は @shunk031 もしくは プロフィールのページ を参照して下さい。\n摂動に頑健で解釈可能な深層学習モデルの開発とその解釈性の評価 令和 3 年度採用分 特別研究員 - DC 申請書 (PDF, 1.8MB)\n審査区分は 情報学 の 知能情報学関連 で、専門分野は 自然言語処理 として申請しました。 研究・職歴等は以下のように記述しました。特に TA や RA、企業でのリサーチインターン等の経験は研究遂行能力に影響を与えると考えました：\n2016 年 10 月 ～ 2017 年 12 月 NVIDIA Japan GTC Japan ティーチング・アシスタント 2018 年 4 月 ～ 2020 年 3 月 ティーチング・アシスタント （法政大学） 2018 年 7 月

（取り下げ者数含む） 416 名のうち、1 次採用・ 2 次採用・補欠それぞれ以下の人数で、採用率は 20.2 % 程度でした（補欠繰上結果が開示された 2021 年 2 月 24 日現在 3）。\n採用内定者数 84 名 1 次採用内定 73 名 2 次採用内定候補者数 19 名 2 次採用内定 8 名 補欠繰り上げ 3 名 補欠繰り上げ採用に関して日本学術振興会の 補欠採用内定者の状況について のセクションを見ると 例年 DC2 全体で数名程度という状況で、今回の繰り上げ採用は非常に稀なケースでした。4\n執筆にあたり参考にしたもの 情報学・自然言語処理等の分野で活躍されている方々のページや申請書を参考にしました：\n小町先生の DC1, DC2 申請書 （言語学，大規模なコーパスを用いた機械学習による名詞句の項構造解析） 吉田先生の DC1 申請書 （メディア情報学，時空間メタデータ検索をキーワード検索に統合したウェブ検索エンジンの実現） 小田さんの DC1 申請書 （知能情報学，同時音声翻訳技術の精度向上） 『学振申請書の書き方とコツ ＤＣ／ＰＤ獲得を目指す若者へ』（大上 雅史）｜講談社 BOOK 倶楽部 私は申請書執筆時点で最難関国際会議の 1 つである学会に論文採択経験があったので、特に小田さんの申請書のストーリー展開や最難関国際会議への論文採択経験の強調の仕方等を参考にさせていただきました。\n学振 DC2 採用の体験談について（2022/04/01 更新） 学内で開催された 2023（令和 5）年度 日本学術振興会特別研究員（ＤＣ１・ＤＣ２）申請に関する セミナー にて、私の学振 DC2 体験談（発表資料 ) という講演をしました。学振特別研究員になってよかったこと、採用までの（長かった）道のり、申請作作成の注意点などをまとめています。\n学内で 申請セミナーの開催 や DC2 申請支援制度 があり、それぞれ活用させていただきました。 ↩︎\n弊学から特別研究員に採用されたのが非常に稀な事例だったようで、大学広報 や 学科のホームページ で取り上げていただけました。 ↩︎\n令和 3 年度（2021 年度）の 採用状況 では、採用内定者数は 83 人でした。最終的な採択率は 19.8 % 程度でした。 ↩︎\n最終的な選考結果が出ないとわかりませんが、コロナ禍による博士学生支援の風潮により 2021 年度の繰り上げ採用が全体的に増えているかもしれません。 令和 3 年度（2021 年度）の 補欠採用内定者の状況について では、補欠採用内定者は 44 人でした。前年度の 8 人に比べて 36 人ほど増えているようです。 ↩︎\n","date":1614427822,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1770812977,"objectID":"af2f28a271500480320a8e09cf191c09","permalink":"https://shunk031.me/post/dc2/","publishdate":"2021-02-27T21:10:22+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/dc2/","section":"post","summary":"補欠繰り上げで
