His research interest is now on computational advertising with a focus on automatic geneartion/evaluation and assistive technology for multi-modal ad creatives.\nPreviously, he got his Ph.D. in 2023 at major in applied informatics, graduate school of science and engineering, Hosei University under the supervision of Prof. Hitoshi Iyatomi. His project was to improve prediction performance and model interpretability through attention mechanisms from basic and applied research perspectives.\nHis personality traits can be summarized as follows:\n ❤️ Love research and development. He is enjoying research life, and he is currently focusing on three research topics simultaneously, e.g., natural language processing, medical image-based computer vision, computational advertising. 📝 Every day read and implement the SoTA models. He has released many re-implementations of models using mainly Chainer and PyTorch. Therefore, based on state-of-the-art cases, he can advise on deep learning-based product design. 😄 High technical communicativity. Summarize what he made and what he studied, and spread such information. This shows that he can input and output regularly.

に少しでもお力になれたらと思い、申請書の公開に至りました。2\n質問等にもできる限りお答えします。連絡先は @shunk031 もしくは プロフィールのページ を参照して下さい。\n摂動に頑健で解釈可能な深層学習モデルの開発とその解釈性の評価   令和 3 年度採用分 特別研究員 - DC 申請書 (PDF, 1.8MB)\n審査区分は 情報学 の 知能情報学関連 で、専門分野は 自然言語処理 として申請しました。 研究・職歴等は以下のように記述しました。特に TA や RA、企業でのリサーチインターン等の経験は研究遂行能力に影響を与えると考えました：\n 2016 年 10 月 ～ 2017 年 12 月 NVIDIA Japan GTC Japan ティーチング・アシスタント 2018 年 4 月 ～ 2020 年 3 月 ティーチング・アシスタント （法政大学） 2018 年 7

今回の選考状況は申請者数 （取り下げ者数含む） 416 名のうち、1 次採用・ 2 次採用・補欠それぞれ以下の人数で、採用率は 20.2 % 程度でした （補欠繰上結果が開示された 2021 年 2 月 24 日現在 3)。\n 採用内定者数 84 名  1 次採用内定 73 名  2 次採用内定候補者数 19 名   2 次採用内定 8 名 補欠繰り上げ 3 名    補欠繰り上げ採用に関して日本学術振興会の 補欠採用内定者の状況について のセクションを見ると 例年 DC2 全体で数名程度という状況で、今回の繰り上げ採用は非常に稀なケースでした。4\n執筆にあたり参考にしたもの 情報学・自然言語処理等の分野で活躍されている方々のページや申請書を参考にしました：\n 小町先生の DC1, DC2 申請書 （言語学，大規模なコーパスを用いた機械学習による名詞句の項構造解析） 吉田先生の DC1 申請書 （メディア情報学，時空間メタデータ検索をキーワード検索に統合したウェブ検索エンジンの実現） 小田さんの DC1 申請書 （知能情報学，同時音声翻訳技術の精度向上） 『学振申請書の書き方とコツ ＤＣ／ＰＤ獲得を目指す若者へ』（大上 雅史）｜講談社 BOOK 倶楽部  私は申請書執筆時点で最難関国際会議の 1 つである学会に論文採択経験があったので、特に小田さんの申請書のストーリー展開や最難関国際会議への論文採択経験の強調の仕方等を参考にさせていただきました。\n学振 DC2 採用の体験談について (2022/04/01 更新） 学内で開催された 2023（令和 5）年度 日本学術振興会特別研究員（ＤＣ１・ＤＣ２）申請に関する セミナー にて、私の学振 DC2 体験談（発表資料 ) という講演をしました。学振特別研究員になってよかったこと、採用までの（長かった）道のり、申請作作成の注意点などをまとめています。\n  学内で 申請セミナーの開催 や DC2 申請支援制度 があり、それぞれ活用させていただきました。 ↩︎\n 弊学から特別研究員に採用されたのが非常に稀な事例だったようで、大学広報 や 学科のホームページ で取り上げていただけました。 ↩︎\n 令和 3 年度 (2021 年度）の 採用状況 では、採用内定者数は 83 人でした。最終的な採択率は 19.8 % 程度でした。 ↩︎\n  最終的な選考結果が出ないとわかりませんが、コロナ禍による博士学生支援の風潮により 2021 年度の繰り上げ採用が全体的に増えているかもしれません。 令和 3 年度 (2021 年度） の 補欠採用内定者の状況について では、補欠採用内定者は 44 人でした。前年度の 8 人に比べて 36 人ほど増えているようです。 ↩︎\n
